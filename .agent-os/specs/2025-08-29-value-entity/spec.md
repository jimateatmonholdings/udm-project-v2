> Spec: Value Entity Implementation
> Created: 2025-08-29
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement the Value entity as the data storage layer that holds actual property values for specific Thing-Attribute combinations in the UDM system. This entity serves as the flexible, high-performance value repository that supports all 8 attribute data types with proper validation, versioning, and historical tracking, enabling dynamic data storage and retrieval across diverse business domains.

## User Stories

1. **As a business user**, I want to store and retrieve typed property values for my business objects (Things), so that I can maintain accurate, structured data that respects the schema definitions established by Thing Classes and Attribute Assignments.

2. **As a developer**, I want to manage Value operations through GraphQL with efficient querying and filtering capabilities, so that I can build performant applications that work with large datasets while maintaining data integrity and validation.

3. **As a data analyst**, I want to access historical versions of property values with change tracking and audit trails, so that I can analyze data evolution, compliance requirements, and business process improvements over time.

4. **As a system administrator**, I want to monitor Value storage performance and data integrity, so that I can ensure optimal system performance and maintain data quality standards across all tenants and business domains.

## Spec Scope

1. **Value CRUD Operations** - Create, read, update, and delete Value records through GraphQL API with support for all 8 attribute data types (string, integer, decimal, boolean, date, datetime, json, reference)
2. **Data Type Validation** - Comprehensive validation engine that enforces attribute data type constraints and assignment-level validation rules before storage
3. **Historical Value Tracking** - Version management and change history for Values with efficient querying of current and historical states
4. **Performance Optimization** - Efficient storage, indexing, and caching strategies for high-volume value operations with <200ms response times
5. **Multi-Tenant Value Isolation** - Secure tenant data separation with optimized query patterns for schema-per-tenant architecture
6. **Reference Value Resolution** - Special handling for reference-type values that link to other Things with referential integrity and cascade operations

## Out of Scope

- Complex analytical queries or reporting (handled by separate analytics service)
- Real-time value synchronization across external systems
- Advanced value transformation or computation pipelines
- Backup and disaster recovery mechanisms (handled by infrastructure layer)
- Cross-tenant value sharing or federation capabilities

## Expected Deliverable

1. **GraphQL Value API** - Browser-testable GraphQL mutations and queries for creating, updating, and retrieving Value data with full CRUD functionality, data type validation, and efficient filtering capabilities.

2. **Historical Value Interface** - Browser-accessible version management system that provides historical value tracking, change auditing, and timeline querying with performance-optimized retrieval.

3. **Value Management Dashboard** - Web interface for browsing, managing, and monitoring Value data with visual representation of data types, validation status, and storage utilization metrics.
