> Spec: Relationship Class Entity Implementation
> Created: 2025-08-30
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement the Relationship Class entity as the template/schema definition layer for relationship types between Things in the UDM system. This entity serves as the structural blueprint that defines how different Thing Classes can be connected, including directionality, cardinality constraints, validation rules, and metadata requirements. It enables dynamic relationship modeling across diverse business domains while ensuring referential integrity and performance optimization.

## User Stories

1. **As a business user**, I want to define structured relationship types between different business object categories (Thing Classes), so that I can model complex business relationships like "contains", "assigned_to", "reports_to" with appropriate constraints and validation rules.

2. **As a developer**, I want to manage Relationship Class definitions through GraphQL with comprehensive schema validation and constraint enforcement, so that I can build applications that leverage typed relationships with guaranteed data integrity and optimal query performance.

3. **As a data architect**, I want to establish relationship templates with cardinality rules, Thing Class constraints, and directional specifications, so that I can ensure consistent relationship modeling and prevent invalid connections across the entire data model.

4. **As a system administrator**, I want to monitor Relationship Class usage patterns and performance metrics, so that I can optimize relationship queries, manage schema evolution, and maintain system performance as relationship complexity grows.

## Spec Scope

1. **Relationship Class CRUD Operations** - Create, read, update, and delete Relationship Class definitions through GraphQL API with comprehensive validation and constraint enforcement
2. **Relationship Type Definition** - Template definition capabilities for relationship types including naming, directionality (unidirectional/bidirectional), and business logic constraints
3. **Thing Class Constraints** - Source and target Thing Class specifications that define which entities can participate in specific relationship types
4. **Cardinality Management** - Support for one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many relationship patterns with enforcement mechanisms
5. **Multi-Tenant Schema Isolation** - Secure tenant data separation with optimized query patterns for schema-per-tenant architecture
6. **Attribute Assignment Integration** - Support for Relationship Classes having metadata attributes through polymorphic Attribute Assignment relationships

## Out of Scope

- Actual relationship instance creation and management (handled by separate Relationship entity)
- Complex relationship analytics or graph traversal algorithms
- Real-time relationship synchronization across external systems
- Cross-tenant relationship class sharing or federation capabilities
- Advanced relationship validation beyond cardinality and Thing Class constraints

## Expected Deliverable

1. **GraphQL Relationship Class API** - Browser-testable GraphQL mutations and queries for creating, updating, and retrieving Relationship Class definitions with full CRUD functionality, constraint validation, and efficient filtering capabilities.

2. **Relationship Schema Management Interface** - Browser-accessible schema definition system that provides relationship template creation, constraint management, and Thing Class integration with visual relationship modeling tools.

3. **Relationship Class Administration Dashboard** - Web interface for browsing, managing, and monitoring Relationship Class definitions with visual representation of relationship constraints, usage metrics, and schema validation status.
