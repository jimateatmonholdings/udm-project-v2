> Spec: Thing Class Entity Implementation
> Created: 2025-08-28
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement the Thing Class entity as the foundational meta-entity that defines structural templates for all business objects in the UDM system. This entity serves as the schema definition that describes what type of Thing an object is and what Attributes it can contain, enabling dynamic data modeling and validation.

## User Stories

1. **As a data architect**, I want to create Thing Class definitions that specify the structure and validation rules for business entities, so that I can establish consistent data models across the system.

2. **As a developer**, I want to manage Thing Class templates through GraphQL operations, so that I can programmatically define and update entity schemas for different business domains.

3. **As a system administrator**, I want to validate Thing Class definitions against existing data, so that I can ensure schema changes don't break existing business objects.

## Spec Scope

1. **Thing Class CRUD Operations** - Create, read, update, and delete Thing Class definitions through GraphQL API
2. **Attribute Schema Management** - Define and manage which Attributes can be associated with each Thing Class
3. **Validation Rule Engine** - Implement validation rules for Thing Class structure and attribute constraints
4. **Thing Class Hierarchy** - Support parent-child relationships between Thing Classes for inheritance patterns
5. **Schema Versioning** - Track changes to Thing Class definitions for backward compatibility

## Out of Scope

- Thing instance creation and management (handled by separate Thing entity spec)
- Complex business logic beyond basic validation rules
- Integration with external schema registries or data catalogs
- Advanced inheritance features like multiple inheritance or mixins
- Real-time schema migration tools

## Expected Deliverable

1. **GraphQL Thing Class API** - Browser-testable GraphQL mutations and queries for creating, updating, and retrieving Thing Class definitions with full CRUD functionality.

2. **Schema Validation Interface** - Browser-accessible validation system that verifies Thing Class definitions against existing data and ensures structural integrity.

3. **Thing Class Management Dashboard** - Web interface for browsing, creating, and managing Thing Class templates with visual schema representation.
