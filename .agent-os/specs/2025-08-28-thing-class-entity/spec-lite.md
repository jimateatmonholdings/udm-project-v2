# Thing Class Entity - Lite Summary

The Thing Class entity serves as the structural blueprint that defines what type of Thing exists and what Attributes it can contain, enabling dynamic schema evolution without requiring code deployments. This meta-entity acts as the foundational layer for UDM's runtime flexibility, allowing new data structures to be created and modified through configuration rather than development cycles.

## Key Points
- Defines the structural schema for Thing instances including available Attributes
- Enables runtime schema evolution without code deployment or database migrations
- Acts as the meta-layer that makes UDM's dynamic data model possible
