> Spec: Thing Entity Implementation
> Created: 2025-08-28
> Status: Planning

## Overview

This spec defines the implementation of the Thing entity as the universal data container within the UDM system. The Thing entity serves as the foundational building block that can dynamically represent any business object (Customer, Product, Order, etc.) by instantiating Thing Class templates with flexible attribute values and relationships.

## User Stories

1. **As a developer**, I want to create Thing instances through GraphQL mutations so that I can instantiate any business object type from Thing Class templates with appropriate attribute values.

2. **As a developer**, I want to query Thing entities with selective field loading through GraphQL so that I can efficiently retrieve only the attributes and relationships I need for specific use cases.

3. **As a developer**, I want to update and delete Thing instances through GraphQL operations so that I can maintain the lifecycle of business objects with proper validation and relationship integrity.

## Spec Scope

1. **Thing CRUD Operations** - Complete Create, Read, Update, Delete functionality for Thing entities through GraphQL interface
2. **Dynamic Attribute Management** - Handle attribute values based on Thing Class definitions with proper type validation
3. **Relationship Handling** - Manage connections between Thing instances including parent-child and peer relationships
4. **GraphQL Field Selection** - Implement selective loading to query only requested attributes and relationships
5. **Performance Optimization** - Ensure efficient data loading and caching for Thing entity operations

## Out of Scope

- Thing Class template creation and management (separate spec)
- Advanced querying features like full-text search or complex filtering
- Bulk operations or batch processing of Thing entities
- Real-time notifications or subscriptions for Thing changes
- Data migration utilities for existing entity types

## Expected Deliverable

1. **GraphQL Thing Creation** - Browser-testable interface for creating Thing instances with attribute values and relationships through GraphQL mutations
2. **Selective Field Loading** - Browser-testable GraphQL queries that demonstrate efficient loading of only requested Thing attributes and relationships
3. **Performance Dashboard** - Browser-testable performance metrics showing optimized query execution times and memory usage for Thing operations
