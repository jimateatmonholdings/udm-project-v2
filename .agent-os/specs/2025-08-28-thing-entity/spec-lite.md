# Thing Entity - Lite Summary

The Thing entity serves as the universal container for all business objects in the UDM system, enabling dynamic creation of any entity type (Customer, Product, Order, etc.) from Thing Classes with flexible attribute storage and relationship management. This core abstraction eliminates the need for hardcoded entity schemas by providing a unified data model that can adapt to any business domain through its dynamic attribute system and inter-entity relationships.

## Key Points
- Universal entity container that can represent any business object type
- Dynamic attribute storage system eliminates need for hardcoded schemas
- Relationship management capabilities for connecting entities across domains
