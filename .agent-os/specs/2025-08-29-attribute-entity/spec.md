> Spec: Attribute Entity Implementation
> Created: 2025-08-29
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement the Attribute entity as property definitions that can be assigned to Things through Thing Classes. This entity serves as the reusable property template system that defines what types of data can be stored for business objects in the UDM system, enabling dynamic attribute assignment and validation.

## User Stories

1. **As a data architect**, I want to create reusable Attribute definitions with data types and validation rules, so that I can establish consistent property standards across all Thing Classes in the system.

2. **As a developer**, I want to manage Attribute definitions through GraphQL operations, so that I can programmatically define and update property schemas for different business domains.

3. **As a system administrator**, I want to validate Attribute definitions against existing Thing Class assignments, so that I can ensure attribute changes don't break existing business object structures.

## Spec Scope

1. **Attribute CRUD Operations** - Create, read, update, and delete Attribute definitions through GraphQL API
2. **Data Type Management** - Define and validate supported data types (string, integer, decimal, boolean, date, datetime, json, reference)
3. **Validation Rule Engine** - Implement validation rules for Attribute data types and constraints
4. **Attribute Assignment Tracking** - Track which Thing Classes use specific Attributes for impact analysis
5. **Schema Evolution Support** - Enable safe modification of Attribute definitions with backward compatibility

## Out of Scope

- Attribute value storage and management (handled by separate Value entity spec)
- Complex validation beyond basic data type and constraint checking
- Integration with external validation systems or data catalogs
- Advanced attribute features like computed properties or derived attributes
- Real-time attribute value migration tools

## Expected Deliverable

1. **GraphQL Attribute API** - Browser-testable GraphQL mutations and queries for creating, updating, and retrieving Attribute definitions with full CRUD functionality and data type validation.

2. **Data Type Validation Interface** - Browser-accessible validation system that verifies Attribute definitions and data type constraints before storage.

3. **Attribute Management Dashboard** - Web interface for browsing, creating, and managing Attribute templates with visual data type representation and usage tracking.
