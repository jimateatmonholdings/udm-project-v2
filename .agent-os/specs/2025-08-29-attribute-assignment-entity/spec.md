> Spec: Attribute Assignment Entity Implementation
> Created: 2025-08-29
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement the Attribute Assignment entity as the bridge connecting Thing Classes to Attributes with specific constraints, validation rules, and metadata. This entity serves as the configuration layer that defines which Attributes can be assigned to which Thing Classes, along with their requirements, ordering, and validation constraints, enabling dynamic schema composition in the UDM system.

## User Stories

1. **As a data architect**, I want to assign Attributes to Thing Classes with specific constraints (required/optional, validation rules, default values), so that I can define the exact schema structure and validation requirements for each business entity type.

2. **As a developer**, I want to manage Attribute Assignment configurations through GraphQL operations, so that I can programmatically configure Thing Class schemas and their attribute requirements for different business domains.

3. **As a system administrator**, I want to validate Attribute Assignment changes against existing Thing instances, so that I can ensure schema modifications don't break existing business object data and relationships.

## Spec Scope

1. **Attribute Assignment CRUD Operations** - Create, read, update, and delete Attribute Assignment configurations through GraphQL API
2. **Constraint Management** - Define required/optional flags, validation rules, default values, and ordering for each assignment
3. **Schema Composition Validation** - Validate that Attribute Assignments create coherent Thing Class schemas
4. **Impact Analysis** - Assess the impact of assignment changes on existing Thing instances and their data
5. **Assignment Metadata** - Track assignment-specific information like sort order, display names, and UI hints

## Out of Scope

- Value storage and retrieval (handled by separate Value entity spec)
- Complex inheritance or mixin patterns between Thing Classes
- Runtime constraint validation of actual attribute values (handled by validation service)
- Advanced UI configuration beyond basic display hints
- Cross-tenant attribute assignment sharing

## Expected Deliverable

1. **GraphQL Attribute Assignment API** - Browser-testable GraphQL mutations and queries for creating, updating, and retrieving Attribute Assignment configurations with full CRUD functionality and constraint validation.

2. **Schema Impact Analysis Interface** - Browser-accessible validation system that analyzes the impact of Attribute Assignment changes on existing Thing instances and provides migration recommendations.

3. **Assignment Management Dashboard** - Web interface for browsing, creating, and managing Attribute Assignment configurations with visual schema composition and constraint management.
