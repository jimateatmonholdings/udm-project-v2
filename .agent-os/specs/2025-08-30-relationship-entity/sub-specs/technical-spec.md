# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-30-relationship-entity/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-30
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

### Core Architecture

**Relationship Type System:**
- Thing Classes serve as relationship type definitions
- Relationship types define allowed source/target Thing Classes
- Support for unidirectional and bidirectional relationship types
- Relationship type metadata configuration through Attributes

**Relationship Instance Management:**
- Individual relationship instances between specific Things
- Source Thing and Target Thing references with validation
- Relationship status tracking (active, inactive, pending, deleted)
- Relationship metadata storage through Values linked to relationship-specific Attributes

**Data Integrity:**
- Foreign key constraints to ensure source/target Things exist
- Relationship type validation against Thing Class definitions
- Circular relationship detection and prevention
- Cascade handling for Thing deletions

### Performance Architecture

**Database Optimization:**
- Composite indexes on (source_thing_id, relationship_type_id, status)
- Reverse indexes on (target_thing_id, relationship_type_id, status)
- Partial indexes for active relationships only
- Database-level constraints for data integrity

**Caching Strategy:**
- Redis caching for frequently accessed relationships
- Cache invalidation on relationship changes
- Relationship traversal path caching
- Thing relationship count caching

**Query Performance:**
- Sub-200ms response times for relationship queries
- Efficient relationship traversal algorithms
- Batch relationship operations support
- Optimized GraphQL resolvers with N+1 prevention

### Integration Architecture

**Entity Relationships:**
- Thing Classes: Define relationship types and constraints
- Things: Source and target entities for relationships
- Attributes: Define relationship metadata properties
- Values: Store actual relationship metadata

**API Architecture:**
- GraphQL mutations for relationship CRUD operations
- GraphQL queries for relationship traversal and filtering
- Subscription support for relationship change notifications
- Batch operations for bulk relationship management

## Approach

### Phase 1: Core Relationship Model
1. Design PostgreSQL schema with proper indexing
2. Implement basic Go models and repository patterns
3. Create core GraphQL schema for relationships
4. Implement relationship validation logic

### Phase 2: Relationship Operations
1. Implement relationship CRUD operations
2. Add relationship traversal capabilities
3. Implement relationship metadata through Values
4. Add relationship status management

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. Implement bidirectional relationship support
2. Add relationship constraints and validation
3. Implement relationship versioning and audit
4. Add performance optimizations and caching

### Phase 4: Integration & Testing
1. Integration testing with existing entities
2. Performance testing and optimization
3. Multi-tenant testing and validation
4. API documentation and examples

## External Dependencies

**Database:**
- PostgreSQL 15+ with JSONB support
- Database migration system
- Connection pooling and management

**Caching:**
- Redis 6+ for relationship caching
- Cache invalidation patterns
- Distributed caching considerations

**Message Queue:**
- RabbitMQ for relationship change notifications
- Event sourcing for relationship audit trails

**GraphQL Stack:**
- gqlgen for Go GraphQL implementation
- DataLoader pattern for N+1 prevention
- GraphQL subscriptions for real-time updates

**Monitoring & Observability:**
- Prometheus metrics for relationship operations
- Distributed tracing for relationship queries
- Error tracking and alerting
