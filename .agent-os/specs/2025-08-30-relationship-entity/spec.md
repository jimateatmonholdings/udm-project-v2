# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Relationship Entity
> Created: 2025-08-30
> Status: Planning

## Overview

The Relationship entity is the final core component of the Universal Data Model (UDM) architecture, designed to define typed connections between Things with directional relationships and comprehensive metadata support. This entity enables the creation of a rich, interconnected data model where entities can be related to each other through well-defined, typed relationships that support both simple connections and complex relationship metadata.

The Relationship entity integrates with all existing UDM entities to provide:
- Typed relationship definitions through Thing Classes (relationship types)
- Actual relationship instances between Things
- Rich metadata through the Attributes/Values system
- Multi-directional relationship support with optional bidirectionality
- Relationship versioning and audit trails
- Multi-tenant isolation following established patterns

## User Stories

**As a system architect**, I want to define relationship types with specific constraints and metadata requirements so that I can create a structured and validated relationship model.

**As a data modeler**, I want to create directional relationships between entities with rich metadata so that I can capture complex business relationships and their properties.

**As an application developer**, I want to query relationships efficiently with GraphQL so that I can traverse entity connections and build relationship-aware user interfaces.

**As a business user**, I want to see how entities are connected and their relationship properties so that I can understand the complete context of my data.

**As a system administrator**, I want relationship changes to be versioned and auditable so that I can track how entity connections evolve over time.

**As a tenant administrator**, I want my organization's relationships to be completely isolated from other tenants so that my data relationships remain secure and private.

## Spec Scope

**Core Relationship Management:**
- Typed relationship definitions using Thing Classes as relationship types
- Directional relationship instances between Things (source -> target)
- Optional bidirectional relationship support
- Relationship metadata through Attributes and Values
- Relationship status management (active, inactive, pending)

**Data Architecture:**
- Multi-tenant schema-per-tenant PostgreSQL implementation
- GraphQL API with comprehensive relationship operations
- Integration with existing Thing Classes, Things, Attributes, and Values entities
- Efficient relationship traversal and querying
- Relationship validation and constraint enforcement

**Performance & Scalability:**
- Sub-200ms API response times for relationship queries
- Efficient relationship traversal algorithms
- Optimized database indexes for relationship lookups
- Redis caching for frequently accessed relationships
- Batch relationship operations

**Business Logic:**
- Relationship type validation and constraints
- Circular relationship detection and prevention
- Relationship hierarchy support
- Business rule validation for relationship creation
- Relationship lifecycle management

## Out of Scope

- Real-time relationship synchronization across systems (future enhancement)
- Relationship analytics and reporting (separate analytics service)
- Relationship visualization UI components (frontend responsibility)
- Advanced graph algorithms and path finding (future enhancement)
- Relationship inheritance and polymorphism (future enhancement)
- External relationship synchronization (future integration)

## Expected Deliverable

A production-ready Relationship entity implementation that:

1. **Completes the UDM Architecture**: Provides the final entity that enables rich interconnections between all other UDM entities
2. **Supports Typed Relationships**: Uses Thing Classes to define relationship types with specific constraints and metadata requirements
3. **Enables Complex Data Models**: Allows creation of sophisticated, interconnected data structures that reflect real-world business relationships
4. **Maintains Performance Standards**: Delivers sub-200ms response times for relationship queries and traversals
5. **Ensures Data Integrity**: Implements comprehensive validation, constraint checking, and referential integrity
6. **Provides Complete API Coverage**: Offers full GraphQL API for relationship management, querying, and traversal
