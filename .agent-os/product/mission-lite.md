# UDM System Mission (Lite)

The Universal Data Model (UDM) System is a GraphQL-first backend that eliminates the 8-12 week data modeling bottleneck in enterprise development, enabling teams to create new business entities in under 5 minutes and reduce product launch cycles by 70%.

UDM delivers runtime schema evolution without code deployment for development teams, data architects, and business analysts who need to rapidly iterate on data models. Unlike traditional systems that force trade-offs between performance and flexibility, UDM maintains sub-200ms response times while enabling complete data model changes through GraphQL mutations, eliminating the architectural bottlenecks that extend enterprise product development cycles by 200-300%.
