# Product Roadmap

> Last Updated: 2025-08-28
> Version: 1.0.0
> Status: Planning

## Phase 1: Core GraphQL Foundation (MVP) (8-10 weeks)

**Goal:** Establish basic UDM functionality with GraphQL-first architecture
**Success Criteria:** 
- Sub-200ms GraphQL query performance for basic operations
- Schema isolation security between tenants
- JWT authentication flow working end-to-end
- Basic CRUD operations via GraphQL

**Implementation notes:** 
- Each UDM entity (Thing class, Thing, Attributes, etc.) **MUST** be implemented, from end to end  This means that we will develop everything required to CRUD that one entity, and have a simple frontend for CRUD operations.
- Create a unique spec for each entity
- Remember, **THIS IS A MVP PROJECT.  DO NOT OVER-ENGINEER**

## Dependencies Map

**Phase 1 → Phase 2:**
- Core GraphQL Foundation must be complete
- Schema-based multi-tenancy provides foundation for advanced features
- Authentication system required for subscription security

**Phase 2 → Phase 3:**
- Advanced features needed for production monitoring
- Relationship management required for federation
- Subscription system needed for comprehensive observability

## Risk Mitigation

**Technical Risks:**
- GraphQL complexity explosion (mitigated by query analysis in Phase 1)
- Multi-tenant data leakage (addressed by schema isolation in Phase 1)
- Performance degradation (prevented by optimization focus throughout)

**Timeline Risks:**
- Federation complexity may extend Phase 3 by 2-4 weeks
- Security review may require additional iteration in Phase 3
- Client SDK development may need platform-specific extensions

## Success Metrics by Phase

**Phase 1:**
- Query response time < 200ms (95th percentile)
- Zero tenant data leakage incidents
- 100% uptime during development phase

**Phase 2:**
- Complex query response time < 500ms
- Subscription delivery time < 50ms
- Bulk operation throughput > 1000 records/second

**Phase 3:**
- Production uptime > 99.9%
- Security audit pass rate 100%
- Client SDK adoption rate > 80% of development teams
